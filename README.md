# criticality
This repository contains the code, written in Matlab, that computes avalanches, and plots the histogram of avalanches' sizes and durations, both with linear and logarithmic binning 
It refers to  paper  "Criticality of neuronal avalanches in human sleep and their relationship with sleep macro- and micro-architecture".

The code ok_N1_avalanches.m computes avalanches, and  gives 
1) a figure of the probability density of the z-score normalized EEG signal amplitude, and 
2) the histogram of avalanche's size and duration distributions, both with linear and logarithmic binning.
